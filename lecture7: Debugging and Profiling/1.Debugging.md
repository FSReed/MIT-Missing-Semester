# Debugging

## Exercise 1

Command: `journalctl --since "1d ago" | grep sudo | grep COMMAND`

## Exercise 3

Output of `shellcheck`:  

```Shell
In Script.sh line 3:
for f in $(ls *.m3u); do
         ^---------^ SC2045 (error): Iterating over ls output is fragile. Use globs.
              ^-- SC2035 (info): Use ./*glob* or -- *glob* so names with dashes won't become options.


In Script.sh line 4:
  grep -qi hq.*mp3 $f &&
           ^-----^ SC2062 (warning): Quote the grep pattern so the shell won't interpret it.
                   ^-- SC2086 (info): Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting.

Did you mean: 
  grep -qi hq.*mp3 "$f" &&


In Script.sh line 5:
    echo -e 'Playlist $f contains a HQ file in mp3 format'
         ^-- SC3037 (warning): In POSIX sh, echo flags are undefined.
            ^-- SC2016 (info): Expressions don't expand in single quotes, use double quotes for that.
