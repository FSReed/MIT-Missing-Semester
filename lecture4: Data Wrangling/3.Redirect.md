# Exercise 3

This is not particular to `sed`, it's the shell's redirect mechanism:

> The shell would interpret `> input.txt` first, which **truncates the file to 0 bytes before any data is written!**.
> Then `sed` would try to read `input.txt`, but the file is empty so it generates nothing at all.

To modify a file using `sed`, `-i` option would be perfect:

```Shell
sed -i 's/origin/modify/'
```
Provided by `sed` manual page:  

> -i[SUFFIX], --in-place[=SUFFIX]  
>    edit files in place (makes backup if SUFFIX supplied)

For example, `sed -i.tmp '...' test_file` would modify the test_file directly, but would make a backup named `test_file.tmp`.
