# Exercise 2

In WSL2, you may need to run `sudo apt install wamerican` first, to get `/usr/share/dict/words`  

Command:  

```Shell
grep -P "(.*a.*){3,}(?<!'s)$" /usr/share/dict/words | sed 's/.*\(..\)$/\1/' | sort | uniq -c | sed 's/^\s*//' > result.tmp
```

- Use `wc -l < result.tmp` to get the total number of combinations we have.
- Use `sort -rn < result.tmp | head -n3` to find the 3 most common last 2 letters.

## Challenge

To generate all two-letters combinations, use:  

```Shell
echo {a..z}{a..z} | tr ' ' '\n' > all.tmp`
```

Format `result.tmp` using `sed 's/^.*\s//' < result.tmp > compare.tmp`
Then diff 2 files:  
```Shell
diff compare.tmp all.tmp | grep '^> | less'
```

The output shows all combinations that don't occur.
