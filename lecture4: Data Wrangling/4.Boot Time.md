# Exercise 4

Ignore the logs with `systemd[1]`, the command would be like:

```Shell
journalctl | grep -iP "systemd\[(?\!1\])\d+\]: startup" | tail -n10 | sed 's/.*in \(.*\)ms./\1/' | sort -n
```

After this, you would get 10 sorted numbers. Then we calculate the average boot time:

```Shell
# Append the command above:
| paste -sd+ | bc
```

This would produce the sum of the time. Divide it by 10 to get the average boot time.
